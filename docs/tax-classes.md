# Tax classes by country

In case you are participating in the OSS procedure taxes must be calculated based on your 
customers countries' tax rate (for a B2C inner EU shipment). 

Some products (e.g. coffee) have different [tax classes](https://europa.eu/youreurope/business/taxation/vat/vat-rules-rates/index_en.htm) (e.g. standard, reduced, greater reduced, super reduced) in different
countries. For that use-case the plugins adds a convenient way to choose country-specific tax classes for specific products.

Edit your product and choose the _Add country specific tax class_ button to add a new tax class for a specific country.
Choose the country and the tax class and save the product settings.
