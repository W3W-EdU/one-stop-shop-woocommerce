# Taxes

In case you are participating in the One Stop Shop procedure tax calculation changes from the default.
By default one would collect taxes for deliveries to customers of an EU foreign country based on your 
own countries' tax rate (e.g. 19 % in Germany). With the participation in the One Stop Shop Procedure you'll need
to collect taxes based on your beneficiaries' tax rate.
