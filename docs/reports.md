# Reports

Reports are key parts of your One Stop Shop compliance. In case you are participating in the One Stop Shop procedure
you might need to report collected taxes on a monthly or quarterly basis. In case you are not yet
participating in the procedure you might need to create reports on a regular basis to make sure you are not 
exceeding the delivery threshold of 10.000 â‚¬.

You may view and/or create reports under WooCommerce > One Stop Shop.
