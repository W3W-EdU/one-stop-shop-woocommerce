# Tax adjustments

The OSS plugin for WooCommerce adds some convenient helpers to make sure your tax
settings (e.g. tax rates) reflect your current OSS participation status.  

When switching from non-participation to participation simply use the _Start OSS participation_
button within the OSS settings to automatically import applicable tax rates for the EU. Be aware to backup
your existing tax rates before using this option as your existing tax rates will be deleted before importing.
