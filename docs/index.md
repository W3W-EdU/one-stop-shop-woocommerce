### Install

To install the plugin either download the ZIP file from the [plugin repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/one-stop-shop-woocommerce) or install the plugin directly from your WordPress administration panel.

### Settings

Depending on whether you are using [Germanized](https://vendidero.de/woocommerce-germanized) or not you may find the OSS specific settings either under WooCommerce > Settings > OSS or under WooCommerce > Settings > Germanized > OSS.

Within the settings you may configure your default OSS status (e.g. whether you are already participating in the OSS procedure or not) and
choose whether to automatically observe the delivery threshold or not. Furthermore you might [automatically adjust your OSS status](tax-adjustments.md).
